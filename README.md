# EdisonProject
Create a basic Movie app to show a list of popular movies and allow a user to select a movie to see more details.  
We will be using this exercise to get a better idea of your coding style, technologies/libraries used, architectural choices, etc.  
There is no “right” answer.  Don’t worry too much about the look of the app; instead, focus more on the functionality.  
Please use Kotlin for the project as we would like to see your ability to use the Kotlin language.
